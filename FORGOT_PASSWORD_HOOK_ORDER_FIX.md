# Forgot Password Page Hook Order Fix - Complete ✅

## Issue Resolution
**Original Error**: `React has detected a change in the order of Hooks called by ForgotPasswordPage. This will lead to bugs and errors if not fixed.`

**Root Cause**: The component had conditional logic that caused hooks to be called in different orders between renders.

## Problem Analysis

### Hook Call Order Issue
The error occurred because the component structure was:

```tsx
export default function ForgotPasswordPage() {
  // 1. useState hooks (5 of them)
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [showSuccessDialog, setShowSuccessDialog] = useState(false);
  // ... more useState

  // 2. useRouter
  const router = useRouter();
  
  // 3. Context hooks  
  const { settings, isLoading: brandingLoading } = useBranding();
  const { t, isLoading: translationsLoading } = useTranslations();

  // 4. EARLY RETURN - This was the problem!
  if (brandingLoading || translationsLoading) {
    return <SimpleLoadingScreen />;
  }

  // 5. useForm - Only called conditionally
  const form = useForm({...});
}
```

### The Problem
- **First render**: Loading states are `true` → component returns early → `useForm` never called
- **Second render**: Loading states are `false` → component continues → `useForm` is called
- **Result**: Hook order changes between renders, violating Rules of Hooks

## Solution Applied

### Fixed Hook Order
Moved all hooks to be called unconditionally at the top of the component:

```tsx
export default function ForgotPasswordPage() {
  // 1. useState hooks (always called)
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [showSuccessDialog, setShowSuccessDialog] = useState(false);
  // ... more useState

  // 2. useRouter (always called)
  const router = useRouter();
  
  // 3. Context hooks (always called)
  const { settings, isLoading: brandingLoading } = useBranding();
  const { t, isLoading: translationsLoading } = useTranslations();

  // 4. useForm (ALWAYS called now - no conditional logic before it)
  const formSchema = createFormSchema(t);
  const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof formSchema>>({
    resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
    defaultValues: { email: '' },
  });

  // 5. Conditional rendering AFTER all hooks
  if (brandingLoading || translationsLoading) {
    return <SimpleLoadingScreen />;
  }

  // Continue with component logic...
}
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Hook Order Guarantee
- ✅ **All hooks now called unconditionally** at the top of the component
- ✅ **useForm moved before any conditional logic**
- ✅ **Early return moved after all hook calls**
- ✅ **Consistent hook order between all renders**

### 2. Schema Creation
- ✅ **formSchema creation** moved to be after translations are available
- ✅ **useForm hook** always called with proper resolver
- ✅ **No conditional hook calls**

### 3. Component Structure
```tsx
// ✅ CORRECT ORDER:
function Component() {
  // 1. All useState hooks
  // 2. All custom hooks (useRouter, useBranding, useTranslations)  
  // 3. All form hooks (useForm)
  // 4. Conditional rendering logic
  // 5. Event handlers and other functions
  // 6. JSX return
}
```

## Rules of Hooks Compliance

### Before Fix (Violated Rules)
- ❌ Hooks called conditionally
- ❌ Hook order changed between renders
- ❌ `useForm` only called sometimes

### After Fix (Complies with Rules)
- ✅ **Always call hooks in the same order**
- ✅ **Only call hooks at the top level**
- ✅ **Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions**
- ✅ **All hooks called on every render**

### Error Stack Trace Analysis
```
Previous render            Next render
------------------------------------------------------
1. useState               useState      ✅
2. useState               useState      ✅  
3. useState               useState      ✅
4. useState               useState      ✅
5. useState               useState      ✅
6. useContext             useContext    ✅
7. useContext             useContext    ✅
8. useState               useState      ✅
9. useState               useState      ✅
10. useEffect             useEffect     ✅
11. undefined             useRef        ❌ <- This was the problem
```

The `useRef` call (from `useForm` internally) was missing in the first render due to early return.

### Solution Verification
- ✅ **Hook 11**: Now consistently called as `useRef` in both renders
- ✅ **Order preserved**: All hooks called in identical order every time
- ✅ **No conditional hooks**: All hooks called unconditionally

## Files Modified

### Updated File
- `src/app/forgot-password/page.tsx` - Fixed hook order and conditional logic

### Changes Summary
1. **Moved useForm hook call** before conditional return
2. **Ensured formSchema creation** happens before useForm
3. **Preserved functionality** while fixing hook order
4. **Maintained loading screen behavior** after hook calls

## Testing Verification

### Before Fix
- ❌ React Hook order violation error
- ❌ Component failed to render properly
- ❌ Development console errors

### After Fix  
- ✅ No React Hook order violations
- ✅ Component renders consistently
- ✅ Loading states work properly
- ✅ Form submission works correctly
- ✅ Translation integration maintained

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Forgot password page now works without React errors
- **Development**: No more hook order violation warnings
- **Stability**: Component behavior consistent across all renders
- **Maintainability**: Proper React patterns followed

## Best Practices Applied
1. **Unconditional hook calls** - All hooks called at component top level
2. **Consistent hook order** - Same order maintained across all renders  
3. **Early returns after hooks** - Conditional logic moved after hook calls
4. **Form hook integration** - useForm properly integrated with translations
5. **Error prevention** - Prevents future hook order violations
